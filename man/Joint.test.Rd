\title{Perform Joint Test on GWAS Summary Data}
\usage{
Joint.test(bZ, RZ)
}
\arguments{
\item{bZ}{A matrix of allele-aligned Z-scores from GWAS summary data, where each row
represents a different genetic variant and each column represents a different trait
or study. The matrix dimensions are n x p, with n being the number of variants and
p being the number of traits or studies.}

\item{RZ}{The correlation matrix of estimation errors for the Z-scores in `bZ`. This
matrix should be p x p, where p is the number of traits or studies.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns: `Chi2`, containing the Chi-squared values for
  each genetic variant, and `P`, containing the corresponding P-values.
}
\description{
This function conducts a joint test on GWAS summary data, calculating Chi-squared values
and corresponding P-values based on allele-aligned Z-scores and the correlation matrix
of estimation errors for these Z-scores.

\dontrun{
# Example usage:
# Assuming bZ is your matrix of allele-aligned Z-scores and RZ is the correlation matrix
result <- Joint.test(bZ, RZ)
}
